If you are looking to create your own GitHub project or contribute to an existing one, understanding commit naming conventions is essential.

# Commit naming convention
---

## 1. Use a Consistent Format

Maintaining a consistent commit message format improves readability and collaboration.

Standard Format:

```Bash
<type>(<scope>): <description>
<type>: <description>
```

‚úÖ Example:

```Bash
feat(auth): add JWT authentication
fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue
```

## 2. Common Commit Types

| Type     | Description                                               |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| feat     | Introduces a new feature                                  |
| fix      | Fixes a bug                                               |
| docs     | Updates documentation                                     |
| style    | Code style changes (whitespace, formatting, missing semicolons) |
| refactor | Code restructuring without changing behavior              |
| perf     | Improves performance                                      |
| test     | Adds or updates tests                                     |
| chore    | Maintenance tasks (e.g., package updates, build process changes) |
| ci       | CI/CD-related changes                                     |

## 3. Writing Clear Commit Messages

Use the imperative mood:

```Bash
‚úÖ "fix(login): handle null password error"
‚ùå "fixed issue with null password"
```

Keep It Concise:

‚úÖ Limit subject lines to 50 characters.

‚úÖ Use present tense (e.g., "fix" instead of "fixed").

‚úÖ Wrap the body at 72 characters per line if additional context is needed.

‚úÖ Keep commits small and focused‚Äîavoid committing thousands of lines at once.

‚úÖ Avoid committing large changes (e.g., 10,000 lines or 100 files) as they are difficult to review.

## 4. Writing Meaningful Commit Messages

‚úÖ Good example:

```Bash
feat(api): add rate limiting to prevent abuse
```

Added an IP-based rate-limiting mechanism using Redis to
throttle requests and prevent abuse. This will help improve
API reliability under high traffic conditions.

Avoid Generic Commit Messages

‚ùå Bad Examples:

```Bash
update
fix bug
refactor stuff
```

‚úÖ Better Alternatives:

```Bash
fix(auth): correct token expiration logic
chore(deps): update React to v18
```

## 5. Use Conventional Commits

If your project follows Semantic Versioning, use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) helps automate versioning and changelogs.

```Bash
feat!: introduce breaking change to API
```

**The "!" indicates a breaking change.**

## 6. Optional: Add Emojis for Readability

Some teams use emojis to make commit logs visually appealing.

Example:

```Bash
‚ú® feat(auth): add OAuth login
üêõ fix(ui): resolve dropdown bug
üìö docs(readme): update installation steps
```

## 8. Summary

By following these commit message conventions, you ensure:

‚úÖ Clear history

‚úÖ Easier collaboration

‚úÖ Better automation (e.g., changelog generation, release management)

Adopting a structured commit naming convention will make your codebase more maintainable and improve teamwork efficiency.
