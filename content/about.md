## Intro

Hi there,

My name is **Benoit Gaumard**, a Cloud Consultant and Architect with a focus on Microsoft Azure and related services. As part of the Microsoft company, I’m passionate about cloud architecture, automation, infrastructure as code (IaC), DevOps, and cloud-native solutions. I created this blog to share insights and knowledge about Microsoft technologies.

Here, I share my experiences and learning, which serves as both a personal reference and a learning tool. I’d love to connect and discuss how I might support your needs!

Based in Paris, France, I work and live with a focus on cloud solutions.
